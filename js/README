This folder contains a very basic Javascript extraction parser
(extracts JS script sections embedded inline in HTML) and a 
simple Javascript processer which can process basic JS actions
that affect the Document DOM and location. These can be used by
a crawler to process JS in webpages to perform operations such
as JS based redirection of a web-page etc.

The code in this folder has been completely derived from the
HarvestMan web-crawler project. The module comments have been 
trimmed but core comments have been retained.
